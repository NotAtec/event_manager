An assignment where given phone numbers had to be cleaned for further processing. The following criteria were applied:

- If the phone number is less than 10 digits, assume that it is a bad number
- If the phone number is 10 digits, assume that it is good
- If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is 1, trim the 1 and use the remaining 10 digits
- If the phone number is 11 digits and the first number is not 1, then it is a bad number
- If the phone number is more than 11 digits, assume that it is a bad number
